        question: "What is included in every IPTV subscription plan?",
        answer: "Every subscription plan includes access to 24,000+ live TV channels from around the world, 80,000+ movies and TV series on demand, HD and 4K streaming quality, all sports and PPV events, anti-freeze technology, electronic program guide (EPG), multi-device support (2 simultaneous connections), instant activation, and 24/7 customer support. The only difference between plans is the duration and monthly cost — longer plans offer bigger savings."

        question: "How quickly is my IPTV subscription activated?",
        answer: "Your IPTV subscription is activated instantly after payment confirmation. Within 1-5 minutes, you'll receive an email with your login credentials and setup instructions. Most customers are streaming within 10 minutes of purchase. If you don't receive your credentials within 15 minutes, check your spam folder or contact our 24/7 support team for immediate assistance."

        question: "Which IPTV subscription plan offers the best value?",
        answer: "The 12-month plan offers the best value at just $7.50/month (total $90/year). Compared to the monthly plan ($16/month), you save 53% — that's $102 in savings over the year. If you're new and want to test the service first, we recommend starting with the 1-month plan. Once you're satisfied (most customers are!), upgrade to the annual plan for maximum savings."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I upgrade my IPTV subscription plan later?",
        answer: "Yes! You can upgrade your subscription at any time. Simply contact our support team, and we'll apply a prorated credit from your remaining subscription toward the longer plan. Many customers start with a 1 or 3-month plan to test the service, then upgrade to the 12-month plan for the best savings."

        question: "What devices can I use with my IPTV subscription?",
        answer: "Our IPTV subscription works on virtually any device: Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, Sony, etc.), Amazon Fire Stick and Fire TV, Android phones and tablets, iPhones and iPads, Windows and Mac computers, MAG boxes, Roku, Formuler boxes, and more. Each subscription allows 2 simultaneous device connections, so you can watch on your TV while someone else watches on their phone."

        question: "Is there a free trial available?",
        answer: "We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee instead of a free trial. This allows you to fully test the service with complete access to all features. If you're not satisfied for any reason within the first 7 days, simply contact our support team for a full refund — no questions asked. This is actually better than a limited free trial because you get the complete experience."
